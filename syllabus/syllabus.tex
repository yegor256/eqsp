\begin{abstract}
The course is a series of loosely coupled pieces of advice related to quality of software development.
Pragmatic programmers may listen to them if they don't want
to tolerate chaos in their projects. The course is not only about
coding practices, but also about static analysis, test coverage,
bug tracking, dependency and artifact management, build automation,
DevOps, and many other things. If we don't do them right, they may
severely jeopardize the quality of the entire project.

% \section*{Introduction}

\textbf{Who is the teacher?}
I'm developing software for more than 30 years, being a hands-on programmer
(see my GitHub account: \href{https://github.com/yegor256}{@yegor256})
and a manager of other programmers. At the moment I'm a director
of an R\&D laboratory in Huawei. Our primary research focus is
software quality problems. You may find some lectures I've presented
at some software conferences on
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q}{my YouTube channel}.
I also published \href{https://www.yegor256.com/books.html}{a few books}
and wrote \href{https://www.yegor256.com/contents.html}{a blog} about software engineering
and object-oriented programming.

\textbf{Why this course?}
In \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPmbRkSWYnY}{one of my videos}
a few years ago I explained what I believe is killing
most software projects: it's the chaos they can't control. Most of us
programmers start projects full of enthusiasm and best intentions.
We are confident that this time the design will be solid, the code will
be clean, and our customers will be happy because there will be no bugs.
Eventually, sooner rather than later, the reality appears to be as bad
as it was in the previous project: the code is messy, the design resembles
spaghetti, and the bugs are unpredictable and hard to fix. We learn some
lessons, abandon the project, and start a new one, again with the best
intentions. But in a new project nothing changes.
Most programmers that I know run in this cycle for decades.
I believe, this course may help you not become one of them.

\textbf{What's the methodology?}
The course is a collection of individual cases not
closely connected to each other. Each lecture discusses a single open-source
GitHub repository. Each discussion highlights the mistakes made in the
repository and suggests improvements. Each lecture ends with a conclusion
and a formulated recomendation. The recomendations may help students
prevent and control chaos in their own future projects.

\section*{Course Aims}

Prerequisites to the course (it is expected that a student knows this):

\begin{itemize}
\item How to use Git
\item How to code
\item How to design software
\item How to write automated tests
\item How to deploy
\end{itemize}

After the course a student \emph{hopefully} will know:

\begin{itemize}
\item How to prevent dependency hell
\item How to use static analysis
\item How to organize automated tests
\item How to design integration tests
\item How to maintain documentation
\item How to avoid code smells
\item How to convince a manager that quality is important
\item How to organize bug tracking
\item How to do code reviews
\item How to configure pre-flight builds
\item How to deal with negligence of other programmers
\item How to practice DevOps being a programmer
\item How to hire a programmer
\item How to measure test coverage
\item How to argue with customers
\item How to discipline fellow programmers
\item How to protect yourself from chaos
\end{itemize}
