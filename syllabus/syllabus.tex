\begin{abstract}
The course is a series of loosely coupled pieces of advice related to quality of software development.
Pragmatic programmers may listen to them if they don't want
to tolerate chaos in their projects. The course is not only about
coding practices, but also about static analysis, test coverage,
bug tracking, dependency and artifact management, build automation,
DevOps, and many other things. If we don't do them right, they may
severely jeopardize the quality of the entire project.

% \section*{Introduction}

\textbf{Who is the teacher?}
I'm developing software for more than 30 years, being a hands-on programmer
(see my GitHub account: \href{https://github.com/yegor256}{@yegor256})
and a manager of other programmers. At the moment I'm a director
of an R\&D laboratory in Huawei. Our primary research focus is
software quality problems. You may find some lectures I've presented
at some software conferences on
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q}{my YouTube channel}.
I also published \href{https://www.yegor256.com/books.html}{a few books}
and wrote \href{https://www.yegor256.com/contents.html}{a blog} about software engineering
and object-oriented programming.

\textbf{Why this course?}
In \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPmbRkSWYnY}{one of my videos}
a few years ago I explained what I believe is killing
most software projects: it's the chaos they can't control. Most of us
programmers start projects full of enthusiasm and best intentions.
We are confident that this time the design will be solid, the code will
be clean, and our customers will be happy because there will be no bugs.
Eventually, sooner rather than later, the reality appears to be as bad
as it was in the previous project: the code is messy, the design resembles
spaghetti, and the bugs are unpredictable and hard to fix. We learn some
lessons, abandon the project, and start a new one, again with the best
intentions. But in a new project nothing changes.
Most programmers that I know run in this cycle for decades.
I believe, this course may help you not become one of them.

\textbf{What's the methodology?}
The course is a collection of individual cases not
closely connected to each other. Each lecture discusses a single open-source
GitHub repository. Each discussion highlights the mistakes made in the
repository and suggests improvements. Each lecture ends with a conclusion
and a formulated recomendation. The recomendations may help students
prevent and control chaos in their own future projects.

\section*{Course Structure}

\section*{Laboratory Classes}

A few following laboratory classes may support the course, where students
will be asked to solve some of these tasks (the most complex are at the bottom):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Configure GitHub Action to publish code coverage to \href{https://www.codecov.io}{codecov}
	\item Make both JUnit4 and JUnit5 tests work inside one Java repository
	\item Create a new unit test in BDD style, using Cucumber or a similar framework
	\item Design a coding style guide (in Markdown) for your favorite language
	\item Configure GitHub Actions to deploy a new JavaScript library to \href{https://npmjs.org}{npmjs}
	\item Automate headless Selenium+Safari integration testing in a simple web app
	\item Automate mutation coverage publishing to \href{https://pages.github.com}{GitHub Pages}
	\item Create a new plugin for GitHub Actions to validate the layout of repository
	\item Merge a pull request improving coding style to a 10k+ GitHub library
	\item Create an automated test for Java+Hibernate+MySQL with \href{https://www.testcontainers.org}{testcontainers}
	\item Create GitHub Action to spell check \texttt{README.md} using \href{http://aspell.net}{aspell}
	\item Install Jenkins and configure it to merge branches on demand
	\item Configure GitHub Action to send a message to Telegram when the build fails
	\item Automate cross-browsing testing of a web app using \href{https://www.browserstack.com}{BrowserStack}
	\item In a existing Java project automated with Maven, replace Maven with Makefile
	\item Automate comparison of two static analyzers, find out which one is stronger
	\item Develop a Maven plugin to check the quality of POM file
	\item Create a new style checking rule for PMD, to prohibit the use of non-final classes
	\item Using \href{http://aspell.net}{aspell}, create a style checker validating grammar in Java comments
\end{enumerate}

There could be other tasks too.

\section*{Grading}

Students may form groups of up to four people. Each group will present
their own public GitHub repository with a software module inside. The group
will make a presentation of the quality control mechanisms that are
present in the repository. They will have to explain during a 10-minutes
oral presentation with live GitHub demonstration via screen sharing:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How enabled quality ensuring mechanisms work?
	\item Why such mechanisms are in use?
	\item How they help ensure quality?
	\item How often they get activated?
	\item What are the drawbacks of them?
	\item What mechanism are not used and why?
\end{itemize}

Most probably, there will
be no more than 20\% of ``A'' marks, no more than 40\% of ``B,''
and the rest will go to ``C'' and ``D.'' However, this distribution is
not mandatory: if all students make excellent presentations, everybody
will get ``A.''

The teacher of laboratory classes may increase or decrease the grade
by one point.

Higher grades will be given for:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Better understanding of the reasons behind used mechanisms,
	\item How they help ensure quality,
	\item How often they get activated,
	and
	\item What are the drawbacks of them.
\end{itemize}

A retake exam is possible, following exactly the same procedure. However,
the highest mark most probably possible at the retake is ``C.''

Students are highly advised to discuss
their repositories and quality ensuring mechanisms with each other,
before the final exam, in order to understand their relative positions
and maybe trigger new ideas.
