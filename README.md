There are slides for my series of lectures for a few universities in Russia.
The series is titled "Ensuring Quality in Software Projects"
All compiled slide decks in PDF are [here](https://yegor256.github.io/eqsp/).

All lectures are video recorded, in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaIsQH4uc08y14wCJMeffS2yErN4QpB8m).

To compile everything just run:

```bash
$ make
```

To clean everything up, do:

```
$ make clean
```

You need to have
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX),
[`aspell`](http://aspell.net/),
[`texsc`](https://rubygems.org/gems/texsc),
and
[`texqc`](https://rubygems.org/gems/texqc)
